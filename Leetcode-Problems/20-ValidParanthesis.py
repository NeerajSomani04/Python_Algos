# In this we are going to solve leetcode #387 problem
# https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/

# we are going to follow a specific process (D, D, P, A, B)
# Definition, Data, Pseudo code, Actual code, Big-O efficiency

## Definition -- Can be easily understood from leetcode problem statement

## Data (IOEA) -- Input, Output, Edge Cases, Assumptions
  # Input -- string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', 
  # Output -- "true" if the input string is valid, else "false"
  # Egde Cases -- empty string is a valid string
  # Assumptions -- string will contain only paranthesis charachters mentioned above

## In this we are going to use Stack. 
  - A very important thing to understand in each problem, which data structure and method (process) will give you optimum result.
  - This can only be possible if you understand the behaviour of each data structure.

''' Pseudo code  --
      - Break a big string input to smaller chunks, known as chunking
      - closing the most recently opening paranthesis
      -

# What is Naive solution:-
   # Its a solution that seems very obvious but usually not very efficient
   # Sometime interviewer wants to check, candidates know naive solution or not. Or build from Naive solution to best solution.
   # A big part of solving problem is comparing different solutions
  
    
    
# Actual code --
## Solution 1:

Question: notes for Aaron
  - "missed "}" paranthesis while describing input of the problem
