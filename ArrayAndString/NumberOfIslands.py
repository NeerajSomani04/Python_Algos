# Lets follow our procedure to solve this question:
'''
Definition - can be understood from question (https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/queue-stack/231/practical-application-queue/1374/)

Data - 
  - Input - an m x n 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water)
  - output - return the number of islands.
  - Edge case - 
  - assumptions - grid can't be empty
  Constraints:
      m == grid.length
      n == grid[i].length
      1 <= m, n <= 300
      grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.
