# Lets follow our procedure to solve this question:
'''
Definition - can be understood from question

Data - 
  - Input - a fixed length array that contains some intergers
  - output - function should modify the array in-place, should not return anything
  - Edge case - no zero at all in the array, at-least 1 element will be in array, zero could be last element in the array, or a zero present on the boundary of the leftover elements.
  - assumptions - 
  
Pseudo code - 
  - read array
